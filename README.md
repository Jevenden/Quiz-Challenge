For this challenge, first I built my HTML, with all the necessary symantic elements, and tried to keep it as minimal as possible so I could practice more with DOM manipulation. I then applied minimal CSS to the HTML elements to style the page. In script.js I started by creating all the variables I would need, then, just for practice, I created the startup page using dynamic HTML rewriting, and hid the scoreboard page for later use.

I then added my initial buttons to start the quiz and show the high scores, respectively, as well as buttons to clear the high scores and restart the quiz, both on the hidden scoreboard. I then programmed the timer and set it to begin when the start quiz button was pressed, which would, in turn, start the quiz. I then used a separate function for each quiz, again primarily for practice, and rewrote my HTML dynamically using javascript, creating the questions and answer buttons as needed, as well as programming the results of the user's choices; both of which would call the next function and display a timed message, below, concerning the accuracy of their answer, but only the correct answer would add to their score, while only the incorrect answer would remove 15s from the timer. The incorrect answers were identified in a group using their name, while the correct answer was defined using an id.

I then repeated the above four more times for the remaining questions, with the final question calling the scoreboard, similarly to the "show high scores" button. I then programmed a submit button that called the user's score from local memory and concatenated it with the submitted name. Finally, I created a "reset quiz" button that resored the quiz to the its default state at page load, which I had to do by dynamically recreating the HTML that I had previously overwritten.
